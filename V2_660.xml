  <description type="morphology">Plants  epiphytic or terrestrial, pendent [erect].  Roots  produced in distal parts of shoots, migrating downward in cortex to emerge in substrate.  Horizontal stems  absent [present].  Shoots  clustered, round in cross section, dichotomously branching, 1.5--5 mm diam.  Leaves  not in distinct ranks [ranked], imbricate or not, monomorphic (or sporophylls sometimes differentiated), appressed, ascending to spreading, linear to subulate, margins mostly entire [denticulate].  Gemmiferous branchlets and gemmae  absent.  Sporangia  reniform, borne individually in axils of undifferentiated or slightly differentiated sporophylls [differentiated sporophylls in strobili].  Spores  pitted to small-grooved, sides at equator convex and angles acute.  Gametophytes  nonphotosynthetic, mycorrhizal, mainly growing buried in humus on trees, branched, paraphysate with uniseriate hairs; ring meristem absent.  x  = 68.</description>

  <discussion>As construed here, Phlegmariurus is very large and diverse. Many groups have been tentatively suggested in this genus (B. Ã˜llgaard 1987). Some of these ultimately may be recognized as subgenera or even genera.</discussion>
