  <discussion>Characters used to circumscribe fern families often relate to cryptic features, e.g., presence or absence of annulus and its orientation, length and diameter (number of cells) of the sporangial stalk, nature of the spores (whether all one kind or dissimilar on a given plant), spore shape, color, ornamentation, and number per sporangium, stem and petiole cross-section anatomy, and adaxial grooving (or lack thereof) of the rachis and costae. In addition, chromosome number, a trait almost never assessable by those doing identifications, is often considered in circumscription of families. As much as possible, these definitive characters have been avoided in the key below, which makes the key artificial in part.</discussion>
  <discussion>In the flora area, species in Hymenophyllaceae, Grammitidaceae, and Vittariaceae sometimes exist primarily or entirely as independently reproducing populations of gametophytes. See species descriptions in those families.</discussion>
